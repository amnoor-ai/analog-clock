# 🕒 Analog Clock

A real-time analog clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that displays the current time with rotating hour, minute, and second hands.

## 📌 Description
This project creates an analog clock that updates every second. JavaScript calculates the current time and dynamically rotates the clock hands using CSS transforms.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time time updates
- Smooth rotation of clock hands
- Hour, minute, and second hands
- Clean and minimal UI

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Working with the Date object
- Calculating time-based rotations
- Using CSS transform: rotate()
- Updating styles dynamically with JavaScript

## ⚙ How It Works
JavaScript gets the current time every second and:
- Calculates the angle for each hand
- Applies rotation using CSS transform
